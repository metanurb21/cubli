# Cubli style ESP32 Self balancing cube.

Please see/use the updated refactored brach SD/updated-code

This is based on design and code by [RemRC.](https://github.com/remrc/Self-Balancing-Cube/blob/main/README.md)
I made some modifications and refactoring of the code to suite my needs, PlatformIO, espressif32@5.0.0 and to use BLE to work with my iPhone along with a PCB schematic and gerber files which have been updated due to an error. A new laser cut design from 1/16" Stainless Steel. A custom made PCP and a few more tweaks to the code to send a "Spin" command and make it rotate on it's vertex and some LED's and sounds.
